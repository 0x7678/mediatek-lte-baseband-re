# MT6735

Primary target: [BLU R1 HD][r1hd]

**NOTE**: Don't buy this phone to develop on--the device as it's being
sold today has been been locked down by Amazon/BLU and (to my knowledge)
can no longer enter preloader download mode. If you want a device to
hack on, the [Orange Pi 4G-IoT][orangepi] is a far more open
alternative, and I'll be porting the scripts in this directory to work
on that device going forward. Check out the
[MT6737M directory](../MT6737M) for more information and scripts for
that device.

Notes on this SoC can be found in [Notes.md](Notes.md).
